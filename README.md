## Overview

This is a possible solution to the Sneakers / E-commerce product page challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6).
The project is a responsive e-commerce product page built using React/Typescript with Vite structure. For the styles I used a combination of Bootstrap classes and CSS.

## Technologies used for the challenge
+ **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
+ **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, great for collective development or debugging.
+ **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for responsive and mobile-first web development.
+ **Vite**: Fast frontend build tool, focused on speed and development experience.


## Features
+ Product image gallery, including a lightbox functionality.
+ Shop cart management: Add and remove items, manage quantity, viewing of indivitdual and total price.
+ Responsive design for different screen sizes: mobile and desktop layouts.

## What I learned
During the process of developing this E-commerce product page I reached another level of confidence in creating and imitating styles that I have access only in images. That's something I had never done before this project.
In doing so I could figure out diverse methods of combining Bootstrap classes and CSS according to my specific styling needs.
